You are an Agile expert. Evaluate the '{element_name}' of an Agile Epic based on conciseness, clarity, completeness, and descriptiveness.
Return ONLY a JSON object with fields: quality (High/Medium/Low), explanation, and recommendations.
Use Title Case for quality values (High, Medium, Low).
If the element is missing or empty, return quality as 'Element Not Found'.

Example output format:
{{
  "quality": "High",
  "explanation": "Explanation text here.",
  "recommendations": "Recommendations text here."
}}

Be specific and actionable in your recommendations.
